# Connect 4 2 player physics project

An initial attempt at a friend’s challenge, a psuedo-physics based game of connect 4. To see the 2nd game-logic focused project see Connect 4 against CPU player respository.

# Motivation

A challenge from a friend to test my understanding of programming and math. I had made circles interact before but a confining grid for those “pieces” seemed like a fun problem to solve!

This was my first attempt and I chose to simulate play using psuedo-physics for the grid and pieces. I was happy to get this working as a human versus human player game, but felt I needed to step back and reapproach the project for making a human versus CPU game. See my second attempt at my Connect 4 against CPU player repository. 

A project that I’m proud to have completed without looking up connect 4 tutorials! 


# Build Status

Functions but breakable

If the mouse is clicked quickly the pieces will run into each other and meet the condition to stop. As long as there’s a couple seconds between clicks the pieces will fall into place, this espcially works if two people share a mouse to play.  


# Built with

Processing, a Java coding environment that lends itself for quick visuals. Or as explained at the [processing website](https://processing.org/)


    “Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.” 


# Features

Object collision detection

Object Oriented Programming


# Installation

The Processing Java Environment, a kind of overlay on the Java framework, requires the P3 Processing editor to write and execute with and can be found [here for download](https://processing.org/download/).


# Credits

I primarily learned to code again, after a long break since a couple college intro courses, from the [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) YouTube channel featuring Daniel Shiffman, Associate Arts Professor at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. Using those lessons in object oriented programming, intermediate level functions, and other basics I was able to find the right equations to reference the squares to each other, and the basics of displaying the game.
